###Coding Exercise

## Prerequisites
Install Node.js  you can get it from [here] https://nodejs.org/en/

##Set-up
1. Clone the repository of the project.
2. As the API wasn't working, my boyfriend created an API. So you will have to follow the instructions on this [repository] https://github.com/Av4t4r/chattr-box

##Run it
Once the API is running, just run the local server:
```
http-server

```
After that, you would be able to access to the project via **http://localhost:8080/index.html**
